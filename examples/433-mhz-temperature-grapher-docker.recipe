#
# This recipe deploys a number of docker containers which can be used
# to log temperature received from a 433Mhz transmitter via a USB
# SDR-dongle.
#
# (Specifics don't matter here, but it is something I use to graph
# the temperature/humidity on my balcony, and within my sauna!)
#
# We start by creating a new directory to store state "~/temperature",
# then we copy a docker-compose.yml file into that directory.
#
# Once the docker-compose file has been deployed we could then
# be ready to launch it - but to demonstrate our functionality
# we go ahead and manually pull the appropriate containers.
#

}

# Write the docker-compose.yml file into the new directory

         target  => "${HOME}/temperature/docker-compose.yml",
}


#
# Pull the most recent versions of the appropriate containers.
#
# Note: If the containers weren't present then docker-compose
# would fetch them.  This is just an example.
